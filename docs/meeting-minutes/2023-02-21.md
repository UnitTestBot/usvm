1. Evalutation and performance:
    - Check performance on big arrays (10^7)
    - Test on algorithmic problems written in DSL (such as sudoku solver)
    - Add logging: solver requests, forks
    - Performance charts to detect degradations and improvements
2. Metics:
    - SMT solver queries per second
    - \# states, \# forks
    - Ratio of solver time to overall time
    - Instruction coverage 
3. We decided to document everything when the core interfaces are settled
4. Discuss Path Selection when the interpreter is ready 
5. Discuss Independent Constraint Set with DSU optimization 
6. Discuss TypeSolver more deeply later

## Details:

Encode `UMemoryRegion` with its updates as `UExpr<KArraySort<*, *>>`. Special case for `URangedUpdateNode` is encoded with `KArrayLambda`, so it's KSMT responsibility
to translate them to underlying solvers.
