## Memory Regions

- We don't want to internalize memory regions, because it requires structural comparison which could be quite complex in time.
- Anyway, we have to cache a result of translation of a memory region. Moreover, results depends on `defaultValue`, so we need to bear in mind it when caching.
- Equals and hashcode on memory regions must be computed lazily 
- Proper caching of memory regions requires multi-indexed arrays in KSMT which is unsupported right now, but soon will be ready

## UModel

- There are shouldn't be `decode` functions in UMemory components.
- UExprTranslator performs decoding based on translated cache. USolver constructs UModel, delegating some calls to UExprTranslator, not to UMemory.
