# TODOs for refactoring

- Elaborate on API
- Make everything internal
- [+] Implement model decoding: use interfaces for MemoryRegions (arrays, field, etc.)
- Reimplement map merging into UMapRegions
- [+] Add (exceptional) `URegisterRef` into `UMemory`
- `Regions.kt`: implement unions? 
- Implement symbolic sets: `memory/collections/SymbolicCollectionIds.kt`. Encoding/decoding?
- Include element remove information into `SymbolicSetRegionBuilder`. For symbolic set do not traverse updates.
- [+] Interpreter uses new API
- [+] Think about getting rid of unchecked casts in ranged update adapters
- [+] Think about moving `contextMemory` from each collectionId to `USymbolicCollectionId`
- [+] Remove all commented out code
- [+] Make everything compilable
- [+] Rebase onto new master
- [+] Repair tests
- [+] collection id equals, hash
