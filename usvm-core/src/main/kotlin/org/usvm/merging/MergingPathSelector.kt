/**
 * Wraps an [underlyingPathSelector] path selector into merging one. The merging done on [peek] function and works
 * as follows:
 * - first, it takes the state from the [underlyingPathSelector]
 * - then it searches for close states to the peeked one via [closeStatesSearcher]
 * - if no states were found, returns the original one
 * - if there are some states, peeks the first one, tries to merge it with the original one and returns the result
 * - if merging fails, returns the closest state to the original one
 * - when there are no successful merges in [advanceLimit] peeks, returns the state from the [underlyingPathSelector]
