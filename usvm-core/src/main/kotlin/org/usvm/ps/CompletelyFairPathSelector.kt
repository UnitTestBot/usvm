/**
 * [UPathSelector] implementation which uses strategy similar to Linux Completely Fair Scheduler
 * to switch between states with different [Key]s (for example, different entry point methods).
 * Keys are stored in queue prioritized with estimated time which has already been spent to states with
 * that key. As a result, a key with the lowest time spent is always peeked.
 * Spent time is estimated as timespan between successive peeks.
 *
 * @param initialKeys complete set of [Key]s which will be used with this instance. Operations with states having other keys
 * are not allowed.
 * @param stopwatch [Stopwatch] implementation instance used to measure time between peeks.
 * @param getKey returns key by state. For the same states the same key should be returned.
 * @param basePathSelectorFactory function to create a [UPathSelector] associated with specific key. States
 * with the same key are maintained in path selector created by this function.
 * @param peeksInQuantum number of peeks to switch keys after. Time is measured between the first and the
 * last peek in such series, if this value is greater than 1.
