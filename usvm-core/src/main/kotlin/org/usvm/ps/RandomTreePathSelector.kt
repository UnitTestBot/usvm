/**
 * [UPathSelector] implementation which selects the next state by descending
 * from root to leaf in symbolic execution tree. The child on each step is selected randomly.
 * (see KLEE's random path search heuristic)
 *
 * This path selector is guaranteed to peek only and all states which were added via [add], even
 * if tree statistics contains some other states or doesn't contain some added states. To achieve this,
 * a separate from path tree collection of states is maintained, and to avoid revisiting the nodes in tree, and to avoid revisiting the nodes in tree
 * which states are not in our collection, an [ignoreToken] added to such nodes. Nodes with [ignoreToken] are not
 * visited on further traversals.
 *
 * @param pathsTreeStatistics symbolic execution tree statistics used to peek states from.
 * @param randomNonNegativeInt function returning non negative random integer used to select the next child in tree.
 * @param ignoreToken token to visit only the subtree of not removed states. Should be different for
 * different instances of [PathsTreeStatistics] consumers.
